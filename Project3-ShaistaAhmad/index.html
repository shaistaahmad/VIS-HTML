		<p>I'm usually busy juggling between working, managing 18 credits worth of a workload in school, and keeping up to my usual no-good antics. I learned a lot of HTML and CSS prior to this class from a website called freeCodeCamp.com, and I accredit a lot of my successes with this class to that learning platform.</p>
